# Bachelors

This project is made for my bachelors thesis. Its purpose is to show, through a couple of simple examples, the use of Ansible.

## Overview

There are implementations of three different stacks: 
* LAMP
* NGINX - Python - PostgreSQL
* Tomcat - Java - Maven

The main purpose is to deploy an application developed in these stacks. 


## Usage

Update the hosts file, then run `bash ansible-playbook site.yml` for any role.
